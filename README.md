# Amazon Sales Report Analysis
## Description
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to extract meaningful insights and trends that can drive business decisions. The analysis covers various aspects, including product performance, sales trends, customer demographics, and revenue growth.
## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn
```blash
pip install (necessary packages)
```
### Libraries
* Pandas is for accessing datastructure and it deals with dataset.
* Matplotlib is used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
* Sklearn is designed for machine learning and data mining tasks.
* Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex plots and offers a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
## Performing EDA
### * Data Inspection
Data inspection in the data analysis process, is used to carefully examine given dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare it for further analysis. It involves assessing the quality of the data, identifying missing or inconsistent values, and getting a sense of the distribution of variables.
## Data Preprocessing
 It involves preparing raw data for analysis by cleaning, transforming, and structuring it to ensure that models can effectively learn from it. Proper data preprocessing leads to better model performance and more accurate insights.
 Here involves,
           * Handling Missing Values
           * Outlier Detection and Treatment
## Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. It involves using visual elements like charts, graphs, maps, and plots to present data in an accessible and easy-to-understand format. The goal of data visualization is to communicate complex data insights clearly and effectively, allowing users to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
### *Histogram

   <img  src=>
It shows the distribution of the sales amounts from the Amount column. This will display the frequency of different ranges of amounts, and the KDE curve will provide a smoothed estimate of the distribution. This visualization helps in understanding the central tendency, spread, and skewness of the sales data, which is essential for further analysis or decision-making.
